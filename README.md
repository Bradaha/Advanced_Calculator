# CalculatorTechnicalExercise

Welcome to my python calculator! 

In this application you're able to do arithmetic such as + - / *
as well as being able to do more complex arithmetic such as BIDMAS calculations
using brackets and exponentials!

The calculator also includes conversion between lbs, stone, gigabytes, bytes, inches to cm and vice versa
you are able to convert between octal, binary, hexidecimal and decimal in this calculator!

I was able to meet every criteria in the requirements section, including all greens, oranges and reds
except for the calculation history.

A challenge I faced was learning how to use python libraries that were new to me (TKinter and Pillow)

To run my project:

1. Please ensure you're on a Windows as I haven't been able to test if this works on other OS's.

2. First run the requirement.bat file when you unzip the project, this will automatically install the necessary packages that will allow you to run the python program!

3. Then just click on the Run.bat file and you'll see my calculator!
